That was the time, I discover the multiverse of this subject, with investment houses, land-banking commercial developments, more and more.</p><p>So, I made the decision to join RE industry to explore more. I joined T-agency and been there for a year, the boss is superbly equipped with knowledge but he's busy to teach, so I switch to CBD Properties JB and followed my current boss. She's the one who really teaches me the mindset behind deals and peoples. She gave me opportunities to perform and allows me to express freely on our marketing approach.</p><p>I positioned myself in a very niche market, which is Industrial properties, or the factories because my first ever deal closed was a factory. AND I have to admit, the money is BIG. I have made tens of thousands in days BUT also nothing in months. The industrial market is really not easy, but It is where my passion is, being educated with economics theory, production is really what amazes me. Being in this line, allow me to interact with all the bosses behind the scenes for all kinds of product you see on the supermarket racks really amazes me. They speak with Volume, they have no time to waste and they like things summarised. Some are really hard to handle machiavellian and some are genuine nice people. But one thing for sure, I have so much to learn from them, that's the reason I like connecting with them.</p><p>A word of advise for all young agent in JB, if you have the want to learn mindset, get yourself a good mentor who can guide you. Real estate is not easy as an one-man journey. Find a good mentor, join some good team and start exploring, and if you are strong enough to hold on, one day the opportunity will come knocking at your door.</p><p>Cheers,<br>Hing</p><picture>
